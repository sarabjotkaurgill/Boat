Description:

Worked on a graphical Swing application that simulates the functionality of a boat. The boat has a position and a velocity.
It also has a fuel tank, which has a maximum capacity, and the fuel level can be between 0 and the maximum capacity.

The boat also have various possible states. 
These could be something like:  Off, Running, Refilling fuel, Capsized  

Using the graphical user interface, the user able to start the boat, stop the boat, increase its speed, decrease its 
speed, change its direction, and to refill the fuel. 

The user interface also display the position and velocity*, as well as the fuel level and fuel capacity. It also give 
relevant messages to the user as needed. 

Rules:

The various actions valid or invalid at various times, depending on the boatâ€™s state/data.

Driving the boat too fast can be dangerous. While driving the boat above a certain speed, there would be a chance 
(per second) that the boat will capsize and sink. This probability increase as the speed increases above the limit. 
If the boat capsizes, it becomes inoperable (cannot perform actions).

If the boat runs out of fuel out on the water, the boat automatically stop and become inoperable.

When the speed is dangerously high, or when the fuel is dangerously low, a warning displayed to the user.
